        <h1>Trading in Forex Market</h1>
        <p>Forex market trades in the largest volume in the world. Forex trading is taking place in each and every corner of the world. The United States Dollar is the Major currency. Most of the other currencies are traded against the USD. Forex trading is just the exchange of currency for the other currency. For example, if I think that USD will rise in the future then I will exchange my INR with USD in the forex market. All the banks take part in the Forex market to make heavy profits. There is also a lot of risks involved in trading currencies. One should invest wisely in the direction of hedge funds using the COT data and doing all the technical and fundamental analysis. Technicals are studying the chart pattern and predicting the next move on the basis of previous moves experiences. Because it is true that <strong> History repeats itself. </strong>But anything can happen. So we should invest using the formula of risk to reward ratio of 1:3 which is a very good risk to reward ratio to earn maximum profits and minimizing the loss. The main aim towards making profits is to minimize the losses. The mistake which most of the people do is that they keep the losses and cut the profits because of that they may earn 1 $ profit on 10 trades and lose 15$ on a single trade. Then ultimately one ends in a huge loss. On should do is by analyzing the market one should set the take profits and stop loss at a level if one fails many trades and only win one of them then he/she should be in profit. Risk management is very important to earn in the stock market. One should take proper knowledge to start trading and gradually learn from the experiences. This is the key to success in trading. Trade forex and happy trading</p>
