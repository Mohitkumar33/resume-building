        <h1>What influences Forex Market</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Inflation Rates</strong> Inflation rates impact every
          consumer, trader or business in some way, shape or form - this is one
          of the key drives that can impact prices of goods and commodities,
          stocks, and crucially, the Forex market. Inflation can be used as a
          scale to measure how quickly goods and services ‘inflate’ (increase)
          over time. Increases in inflation indicate that prices of said goods
          and services are rapidly climbing. That being said, even if the rate
          of inflation decreases, prices of goods are still on the rise - just
          at a slower pace. As inflation rates increase, the spending power of a
          household will decrease meaning that household may have to cut back on
          a few luxuries and economize in certain areas. I.e. Buy cheaper cuts
          of meat from the butchers or not buy designer footwear. On a larger
          scale, this can have a broader impact on countries as a whole and the
          overall performance of their currency in the Forex market. The same
          can be said with deflation. If investors see that prices of goods and
          services are falling, this may be an indicator that the economy is not
          in such good shape - meaning that inflation, as well as deflation, can
          be signs of a poorly performing economy, in turn negatively impacting
          a country's currency. In situations as stated, this is where central
          banks usually step in and attempt to find an appropriate level of
          inflation usually close to the 2% mark. Should the inflation rate move
          within the range set by a central bank, this will not affect a
          currencies value too much. However, if this moves outside the
          inflation range, then this can drastically affect the currency value
          of a particular nation. To counter this and protect consumers, central
          banks move towards raising interest rates. In terms of Forex trading,
          when inflation rates are high, a trader will usually buy a currency
          within their fx account (going long). If a trader sees that central
          banks will increase interest, then this is a key indicator that will
          increase the value of a currency. That being said, too much inflation
          can harm the capital within an economy. For these reasons, it is
          useful to understand inflation rates as an economic indicator but very
          difficult to use as a sole indicator of whether the value of a
          currency will increase or decrease. There are several; causes of
          inflation. These include Government debt, Monetary and Fiscal Policy,
          Consumer Confidence, Manufacturing Costs and Currency Devaluation to
          name but a few. Government Debt When a country borrows money, they
          take on debt. To repay these monies, governments will implement policy
          to cover the aforementioned debt. Methods may include an increase in
          cash money printed or, probably the most popular form - raising taxes.
          Higher taxes to businesses will, in turn, impact the consumer in that
          they pay a higher price for goods and services rendered. This is a
          natural chain effect in the cost being handed down, the further down
          the chain money travels - passing on the corporate tax increase to the
          consumer to continue to operate at a profit. Increasing the money
          supply in a country is the primary cause of inflation. As a Forex
          trader, government debt can be used as a good indicator of economic
          stability. When we use Greece as a case study and the banking collapse
          of 2009, this led to a spike in interest rates and a distrust in the
          banks themselves. As a trader, one would look at the impact and strain
          this would have on the Euro as the EU looked to bail Greece out of
          financial ruin. In this case, it would be better to short the Euro.
          Interestingly, this also had an impact on Cryptocurrency. When the
          bailouts in Greece happened, the Greek bank account holders who held
          more than $100,000 in their accounts were liable to contribute towards
          paying off the EU debt. This was a term and condition set by Brussels
          in that they would not bail Greek banks out the full amount. The
          account holders with over $100,000 had up to 40% of their capital
          wiped out. Of course, this had a massive impact on the value of the
          Euro. What it also signaled was a transition in the trust from
          centralized currencies into Cryptocurrencies. At the time of the
          collapse, the price in Cryptocurrency surged, due to a massive
          distrust in centralized banking systems. Traders were capitalizing on
          this Government debt and going long on Cryptocurrencies with profit in
          mind. Interest Rates Interest rates are set by central banks as a tool
          to manage an economy by 2 standard methods; Increase interests to
          manage inflation Lowering interest to help economic growth When
          central banks of countries lend money to other banks, standard
          interest determine the amount of money the borrowing banks must repay.
          Larger banks also lend to smaller banks as well as civilians and
          businesses in the shape of loans to gain interest. When banks increase
          their interest rates, borrowers naturally are exposed to a greater
          expense when borrowing - interest rates increase as does the amount of
          money due back to the bank. To put interest rates into context, higher
          interest rates mean that homeowners will have an increase in their
          monthly mortgage repayments. This is a tool used to tackle excessive
          inflation. If a household has less disposable income each month, they
          will not excessively spend. Households with greater outgoings will
          have less money to spend on non-essentials. As consumer demand
          subsides, so does the price of goods and services. There are a few
          benefits to higher interest rates. A higher interest rate indicates a
          stronger economy meaning an increase to potential investors. Meaning
          the more investment into an economy, the greater the strength of the
          currency of that particular country. As a trader, search for a forex
          broker which will allow you a range of currency pairs to trade on. The
          more research a trader puts into interest rates, a better idea they
          will have of economic performance. A strong economy indicates a strong
          currency. Summary What we can take away from this article is that
          economic indicators undoubtedly help identify the strengths and
          weaknesses of an economy. As a trader and aiming to become a
          successful Forex trader, we can use such economic reports to determine
          the probable value of a nation's currency. Increased interest rates
          are used as a tool to keep inflation down and to help stimulate
          economic growth. When we look at inflation we can see that this is a
          tool used to measure price increases on products and services and how
          they increase over time. As a trader, it is important to use a range
          of research materials when thinking about the strength of one currency
          lined up against another. What is also of pinnacle importance on the
          path to success is to remain current. What we mean by this is keeping
